# Demographic analysis of the European population

Program created to put into practice the numerical analysis techniques acquired through an exercise given by Professor Demeio Lucio (UNIVPM).
The exercise consists of analyzing the demographic trend of the European population between 1950 and 2015 through a table showing the population numbers every 5 years (text of the exercise attached).
Specifically, the program plots the population trend by deriving relative and absolute maximum and minimum points; in addition, the program derives the growth rate giving information on the speed of population growth over time.

## Numerical analysis techniques used and application in the exercise:

* `Interpolation by splines`: Used to derive midpoints of values for both popalation trend and growth rate.  
* `Derivation by 3-point formula`: Used to calculate the derivative of the population trend and growth rate in order to determine the maximum and minimum points.
* `Bisection method`: Used to determine the zeros of the derivative so as to get the points of relative maximum and minimum.
